# Tailwind CSS Styling Issue with Conditionally Rendered Empty Components

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS styles are not applied when a component conditionally renders empty content in Next.js/Nuxt.js applications.  The issue occurs when a component renders nothing, or null, even if it has a valid class applied which should apply some Tailwind styles.

## Bug Description

The problem arises when a component's conditional rendering results in an empty or null return.  Even with correctly applied Tailwind classes, styles fail to apply in these scenarios, leading to unexpected visual results.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the development server (e.g., `npm run dev`).
4. Observe the component's behavior when the conditional rendering changes.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the component always renders some valid HTML, even when the conditional rendering results in an empty state. This approach is explored in the `bugSolution.js` file. This file uses a simple trick to always output a single non-breaking space.  This ensures that the parent div with Tailwind classes is always rendered with content, triggering the expected styling from Tailwind CSS.
